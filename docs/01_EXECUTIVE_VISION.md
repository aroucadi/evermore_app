# 01. Executive & Product Vision

## 1. Mission & Problem Statement

### Mission
To preserve the legacy of seniors through intelligent, active conversation, turning ephemeral memories into enduring, accessible family artifacts using advanced voice AI.

### Problem Statement
**Primary Problem:** Cognitive decline and memory loss (Alzheimer's/Dementia) rob seniors of their personal history and identity. Reminiscence therapy is clinically proven to help but is expensive and inaccessible.
**Secondary Problem:** Families lose priceless oral history when elders pass away. Passive recording tools have low engagement and completion rates.

### Core Philosophy
**Active Living Biographer:** Recall is not a passive recorder; it is an active conversationalist ("The Director") that guides, stimulates, and structures memories.
**Visual Memory Anchoring:** We use the "Proustian Trigger" – using visual stimuli (photos) to unlock deep, specific conversational memories.

## 2. Target Users & Personas

### Primary User: "Arthur" (The Senior)
- **Age:** 75-90
- **Tech Proficiency:** Low to Moderate. Comfortable with voice, less with complex UIs.
- **Motivation:** Wants to be remembered, fears being a burden, enjoys conversation.
- **Key Need:** Simplicity, patience, natural voice interaction (no "Hey Siri" commands).

### Secondary User: "Sarah" (The Family Steward)
- **Age:** 45-60
- **Tech Proficiency:** High.
- **Motivation:** Guilt over not spending enough time, desire to preserve family history for children.
- **Key Need:** Visibility into Arthur's well-being, tangible artifacts (books/audio), safety alerts.

## 3. Value Proposition

1.  **Zero-Friction Capture:** No typing, no forms. Just talking to a compassionate voice.
2.  **Therapeutic Benefit:** Validates the senior's life experience through active listening and intelligent follow-up questions.
3.  **Automated Artifacts:** Turns raw audio into structured, beautiful "Storybook Chapters" automatically.
4.  **Safety & Peace of Mind:** Passive monitoring for cognitive decline or crisis keywords during conversations.

## 4. Success Metrics (KPIs)

-   **Engagement:** Average Session Duration (>15 mins).
-   **Retention:** Weekly Active Seniors (>3 sessions/week).
-   **Artifact Value:** Chapter Completion Rate (Sessions successfully converted to Chapters).
-   **Family Satisfaction:** Open Rate of "New Chapter" emails.

## 5. Non-Goals & Exclusions (MVP)

-   **Clinical Diagnosis:** Recall is a companion, not a doctor. No medical diagnoses will be provided.
-   **Native Mobile Apps:** MVP is a responsive Web Application (PWA ready).
-   **Real-time Video:** Voice-only communication (with image upload capabilities).
-   **Complex ACLs:** Single family account structure (One Senior linked to multiple Family members).

## 6. Assumptions & Constraints

-   **Connectivity:** Senior must have stable internet (WiFi/4G).
-   **Language:** English only for MVP.
-   **Device:** Accessible via standard web browser (Chrome/Safari/Edge) on Tablet or Desktop.
