## Experiment 1: Senior AI Engagement

### Hypothesis

Seniors will engage in meaningful voice conversations with an AI system, completing full sessions and returning for more.

### Experiment Design

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Usability pilot |
| Sample size | 50 seniors |
| Duration | 4 weeks |
| Recruitment | Senior centers, family referrals |
| Conditions | Supervised first session, then independent |

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Floor |
|--------|--------|-------|
| First session completion | >70% | 50% |
| D7 return rate | >50% | 30% |
| Stories captured per session | 1+ average | 0.5 |
| Net Promoter Score | >30 | 0 |

### Measurement

| Data Point | Collection Method |
|------------|-------------------|
| Session starts | Automatic logging |
| Session completions | Automatic logging (>5 min duration) |
| Return visits | Automatic logging |
| Stories captured | Content analysis of transcripts |
| User satisfaction | Post-session 3-question survey |

### Learning Outcomes

| If Target Met | Then |
|---------------|------|
| Yes | Validate core value prop, proceed to beta |
| Partial (floor met) | Identify friction points, iterate on UX |
| No | Pivot: consider human-assisted model or different modality |

## Experiment 2: Voice vs. Hybrid Interface

### Hypothesis

Voice-only interface outperforms hybrid (voice + text) interface for senior engagement.

### Experiment Design

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | A/B test |
| Sample size | 100 seniors (50/50 split) |
| Duration | 3 weeks |
| Control | Voice-only interface |
| Variant | Hybrid with text input option |

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Hypothesis |
|--------|------------|
| Session completion rate | Voice-only > Hybrid |
| Session duration | Voice-only > Hybrid |
| Stories captured | Voice-only > Hybrid |
| User preference | Voice-only preferred |

### Measurement

| Data Point | Collection Method |
|------------|-------------------|
| Session metrics | Automatic logging per variant |
| Input method used | Automatic logging (voice vs. text) |
| User preference | Exit survey |

### Learning Outcomes

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Voice-only wins significantly | Maintain voice-only architecture |
| Marginal difference | Consider hybrid for accessibility |
| Hybrid wins | Reconsider voice-first premise |

## Experiment 3: Family Willingness to Pay

### Hypothesis

Adult children will pay $20/month for a service that engages their senior parent in meaningful conversation.

### Experiment Design

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Pricing page test |
| Sample size | 1,000 landing page visitors |
| Duration | 2 weeks pre-launch |
| Conditions | Real pricing, credit card entry |

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Floor |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Landing page to signup conversion | >5% | 2% |
| Signup to paid conversion | >15% | 8% |
| Price point acceptance | >60% choose $19.99 tier | 40% |

### Measurement

| Data Point | Collection Method |
|------------|-------------------|
| Page views | Analytics |
| Email signups | Form submissions |
| Payment info submissions | Checkout flow tracking |
| Tier selection | Checkout flow tracking |

### Learning Outcomes

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Target met | Launch with current pricing |
| Floor met | Test lower price points |
| Below floor | Pivot pricing model (freemium, B2B first) |

## Experiment 4: Photo Trigger Effectiveness

### Hypothesis

Family-contributed photos trigger more and richer story-sharing than unprompted sessions.

### Experiment Design

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Within-subjects comparison |
| Sample size | 30 active seniors |
| Duration | 2 weeks |
| Conditions | Alternate photo-triggered and unprompted sessions |

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Hypothesis |
|--------|------------|
| Stories captured | Photo sessions > Unprompted |
| Story word count | Photo sessions > Unprompted |
| Emotional depth | Photo sessions > Unprompted |
| User preference | Prefer photo-triggered |

### Measurement

| Data Point | Collection Method |
|------------|-------------------|
| Stories per session | Content analysis |
| Word count | Automatic transcript analysis |
| Emotional language | Sentiment analysis |
| User feedback | Post-session question |

### Learning Outcomes

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Photos significantly better | Prioritize photo contribution features |
| Marginal difference | Keep as secondary feature |
| No difference | Deprioritize, focus on other triggers |

## Experiment 5: Safety System Acceptance

### Hypothesis

Seniors accept and trust safety interventions (scam warnings, wellbeing checks) without feeling patronized.

### Experiment Design

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Scripted scenario testing |
| Sample size | 20 seniors |
| Duration | 1 week |
| Conditions | Introduce safety triggers in controlled sessions |

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Intervention acceptance | >80% express appreciation |
| Session abandonment after intervention | <10% |
| Trust score post-intervention | No decrease |

### Measurement

| Data Point | Collection Method |
|------------|-------------------|
| Reaction to intervention | Observer notes |
| Session behavior | Automatic logging |
| Trust survey | Pre/post comparison |
| Qualitative feedback | Debrief interview |

### Learning Outcomes

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| High acceptance | Deploy safety systems as designed |
| Mixed reception | Adjust tone, reduce false positives |
| Negative reception | Redesign intervention UX entirely |
