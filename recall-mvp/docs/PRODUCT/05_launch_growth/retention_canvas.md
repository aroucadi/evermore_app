# Recall Retention Canvas

---

## Retention Model

Recall has two retention surfaces that must be optimized together:

1. **Senior retention**: Seniors continuing to engage in sessions
2. **Family retention**: Families continuing to pay and engage with dashboard

Success requires both. Senior engagement drives family value. Family payment enables senior access.

| Repetitive content | Same stories repeatedly | New topic paths, photo triggers |

### Intervention Playbook

## Cohort Analysis Framework

### Cohorts to Track

| Cohort | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| By acquisition channel | Organic vs. paid vs. referral |
| By senior engagement | High (4+/week) vs. medium (2-3) vs. low (1) |
| By family engagement | Active contributor vs. passive viewer |
| By pricing tier | Basic vs. Plus |

### Retention Questions

1. Do photo-triggered users retain better than unprompted users?
2. Does family contribution predict senior engagement?
3. Does prompt responsiveness predict long-term retention?
4. Which acquisition channels produce highest LTV customers?
