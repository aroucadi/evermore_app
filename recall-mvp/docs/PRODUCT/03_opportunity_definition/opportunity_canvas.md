# Recall Opportunity Canvas

## Problem Statement

### Primary Problem

Seniors possess valuable life stories and memories that are being lost to time, cognitive decline, and isolation. There is no accessible, dignified way for them to preserve and share their experiences before these memories fade.

### Secondary Problem

Adult children of aging parents face a closing window to capture family history. By the time they recognize the urgency, opportunities are often lost. Existing solutions require effort the senior cannot or will not invest.

## Problem Evidence

| Evidence Type | Finding |
|---------------|---------|
| **Demographic** | 56 million Americans aged 65+, growing 3% annually |
| **Isolation data** | 25% of seniors experience social isolation |
| **Memory decline** | 40% of adults 65+ have age-associated memory impairment |
| **Regret research** | 70% of adults regret not asking parents more questions before death |
| **Technology gap** | Only 42% of seniors 75+ own a smartphone they actively use |

---

## Current Solutions and Gaps

| Solution | Limitation |
|----------|------------|
| **Family phone calls** | Infrequent, rushed, no persistence, no structure |
| **Journaling apps** | Require typing; seniors don't use them |
| **Oral history services** | Expensive ($1,000+), one-time, not accessible |
| **StoryCorps** | Requires travel, scheduling, one-time recording |
| **Generic voice assistants** | No memory, no empathy, task-focused |
| **Video calls** | Require scheduling, technical setup, family availability |

### Gap Analysis

| Unmet Need | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Always available | Not addressed |
| Voice-first | Partially addressed by voice assistants |
| Remembers context | Not addressed |
| Empathetic and patient | Not addressed |
| Captures and persists stories | Not addressed |
| Shares with family | Not addressed |
| Protects from harm | Not addressed for seniors specifically |
