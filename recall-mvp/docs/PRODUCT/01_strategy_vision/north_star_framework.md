# Evermore North Star Framework

---

## North Star Metric

### Weekly Active Storytelling Sessions

**Definition**: The number of conversation sessions per week where at least one memory or story is captured.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Metric | Weekly Active Storytelling Sessions |
| Target (Year 1) | 3,000 sessions/week |
| Target (Year 2) | 50,000 sessions/week |

### Why This Metric

| Criterion | Evaluation |
|-----------|------------|
| **Reflects value to user** | A session where a story is captured means the senior felt heard and their legacy grew |
| **Measurable** | Sessions are discrete, trackable events with clear start/end |
| **Leading indicator** | Correlates with retention, family engagement, and eventual conversion |
| **Actionable by team** | Product, AI, and UX can all influence session quality and frequency |

### What It Is Not

- Not "total sessions" (would include failed or abandoned interactions)
- Not "stories captured" (hard to define consistently, gaming risk)
- Not "MAUs" (too lagging, doesn't reflect depth)

## Input Metrics

### 1. New Senior Activation Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of registered seniors who complete at least one full storytelling session within 7 days.

| Target | Baseline |
|--------|----------|
| 60% | TBD (MVP) |

**Why it matters**: If seniors don't complete onboarding and first session, they never become active users.

**Who owns it**: Onboarding UX, Voice quality.

---

### 2. Session Completion Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of started sessions that result in at least one captured story.

| Target | Baseline |
|--------|----------|
| 80% | TBD (MVP) |

**Why it matters**: Incomplete sessions indicate friction, confusion, or poor AI quality.

**Who owns it**: AI quality, Prompt engineering.

---

### 3. Return Session Rate (D7)

**Definition**: Percentage of seniors who return for a second session within 7 days of their first.

| Target | Baseline |
|--------|----------|
| 50% | TBD (MVP) |

**Why it matters**: Measures whether the first experience was valuable enough to repeat.

**Who owns it**: Persona adaptation, Memory continuity.

---

### 4. Family Dashboard Engagement

**Definition**: Percentage of family accounts that view the dashboard at least once per week.

| Target | Baseline |
|--------|----------|
| 70% | TBD (MVP) |

**Why it matters**: Family engagement drives premium conversion and senior encouragement.

**Who owns it**: Family product, Notifications.

---

### 5. Safety Intervention Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of sessions where a safety system (scam detection, crisis intervention) is triggered.

| Target | Baseline |
|--------|----------|
| < 0.5% | TBD (MVP) |

**Why it matters**: High rate indicates either unsafe conditions or over-sensitive systems.

**Who owns it**: Trust and Safety.

## Connection to Business Outcomes

```
Weekly Active Storytelling Sessions
         │
         ├── Drives retention (seniors return for more sessions)
         │
         ├── Drives family engagement (more stories = more dashboard visits)
         │
         ├── Drives conversion (value demonstrated → willingness to pay)
         │
         └── Drives referrals (satisfied families recommend to others)
                  │
                  ▼
           Revenue Growth
```

| Business Outcome | Relationship |
|------------------|--------------|
| Monthly Recurring Revenue | Sessions → Retention → Conversion → Revenue |
| Customer Acquisition Cost | Referrals from satisfied users reduce CAC |
| Lifetime Value | More sessions = deeper engagement = longer retention |
| Brand Reputation | Quality sessions = trust = defensible moat |
