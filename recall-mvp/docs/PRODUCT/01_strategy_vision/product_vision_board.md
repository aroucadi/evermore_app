## Vision

**Every senior can preserve and share their life story, creating a lasting legacy for generations to come.**

We envision a world where no life story is lost to time, memory, or isolation. Where elderly individuals feel heard, valued, and connected. Where families inherit not just possessions, but the wisdom, experiences, and voice of their loved ones.
