# Recall Lean Canvas

---

## Problem

### Top 3 Problems

1. **Memory loss isolation**: Seniors losing memories before they can share them, with no one to listen

2. **Family disconnection**: Adult children geographically or emotionally distant from aging parents, missing the window to capture stories

3. **Technology exclusion**: Existing tools require typing, screens, and interfaces seniors cannot or will not use

### Existing Alternatives

| Alternative | Limitation |
|-------------|------------|
| Family phone calls | Infrequent, rushed, no persistence |
| Journaling apps | Require typing, no guidance |
| Oral history services | Expensive, not accessible, one-time |
| Generic voice assistants | No empathy, no memory, task-focused |

---

## Unfair Advantage

| **Trust with vulnerable population** | Reputation that takes years to build, seconds to lose |

## Risks and Hypotheses

| Hypothesis | Risk Level | Validation Approach |
|------------|------------|---------------------|
| Seniors will talk to an AI | High | Pilot with 50 seniors, measure session completion |
| Voice is preferable to typing | Medium | Compare engagement across modalities |
| Families will pay for stories | High | Pre-launch survey, beta conversion test |
| Safety systems prevent harm | Critical | Red team testing, incident tracking |
