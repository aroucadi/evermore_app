## What is Recall

Recall is an **empathetic AI biographer for seniors**. It helps elderly users recount, preserve, and share their life stories through natural voice conversations, photo-triggered memories, and a persistent knowledge base that grows with every interaction.

Recall is not a chatbot. It is an agentic AI system with:

- Multi-modal inputs (voice, text, images)
- Tiered memory architecture (short-term, semantic, episodic)
- ReAct reasoning with explicit planning
- Safety-first design (scam detection, crisis intervention, medical guardrails)
- Family connectivity for legacy sharing
